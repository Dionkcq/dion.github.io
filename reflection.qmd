## Reflection on the Use of Generative AI

As a student of Applied Artificial Intelligence at Singapore Institute of Technology, I've had the opportunity to explore and utilize various generative AI tools in my academic and personal projects. This page serves as a reflection on my experience with these tools and their impact on my learning and development.

### My Experience with GenAI Tools

#### Tools I've Used

I've experimented with several generative AI tools throughout my studies and projects:

- **Large Language Models** (like Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) for research assistance, brainstorming, and content development
- **Code Generation Tools** for assistance in programming tasks and debugging
- **Image Generation Models** for creating visual concepts and mock-ups

#### How GenAI Assisted My Work

The integration of generative AI has significantly impacted my approach to problem-solving and learning:

1. **Research Acceleration**: GenAI tools have helped me quickly gather and synthesize information from various sources, allowing me to build a comprehensive understanding of complex topics in less time.

2. **Ideation and Brainstorming**: When facing creative blocks, AI has been invaluable in generating alternative perspectives and approaches I might not have considered.

3. **Learning New Programming Concepts**: AI tools have assisted me in understanding unfamiliar programming patterns and languages, often providing explanations and examples that clarify complex concepts.

4. **Website Development**: For this very website, GenAI helped me structure content and suggested efficient ways to implement features in Quarto.

### Benefits and Challenges

#### Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Reduced time spent on routine tasks, allowing focus on higher-level thinking
- **Learning Support**: Provided alternative explanations when I encountered difficult concepts
- **Versatility**: Applicable across various domains from code to content creation

#### Challenges

- **Over-reliance Concerns**: The temptation to use AI without developing my own understanding
- **Quality Verification**: Needed to verify AI-generated information for accuracy
- **Technical Limitations**: Current AI tools still struggle with certain specialized topics

### Future Applications

Looking ahead, I plan to incorporate GenAI in my studies and projects by:

- Using it as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement for my own thinking
- Leveraging AI for initial drafts and ideas, then refining with my domain knowledge
- Exploring cutting-edge applications of AI in my field of engineering and cryptocurrency development

### Final Thoughts

Generative AI represents a powerful tool in my academic and professional toolkit. While I recognize its limitations, I've found that when used mindfully, it enhances rather than diminishes my own capabilities. The key has been developing a balanced approach that uses AI as an amplifier for my own skills and knowledge rather than a substitute.

I believe that developing fluency with these tools is not just advantageous but necessary for future professionals in technical fields, and I'm excited to continue exploring the potential of AI as both a subject of study and a tool for innovation.
